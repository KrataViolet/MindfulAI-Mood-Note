## 🛠️ Run Locally and Development

This repository contains everything you need to run and develop your app.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

### Steps

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    In the project root directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set the LLM API Key:**
    The AI analysis feature requires the `AI_API_KEY`. Set this key in a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. The Vite configuration handles making this available to the app.
    ```
    AI_API_KEY="YOUR_AI_API_KEY"
    ```

3.  **Run the app:**
    Run the app in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Production Build

To create a production-ready build for deployment, use the following command:
```bash
npm run build
# The optimized static files will be generated in the `dist` folder.
